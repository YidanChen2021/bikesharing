# Bike Sharing in NYC Data Analysis
## The purpose of the analysis  
This analysis is conducted to analysis the bike sharing database from NYC to give investor an idea of the feasibility of starting Citi bike sharing service in Des Moines. The analysis result was published on Tableau Public [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yidan.chen8013/viz/BikeSharingNYC_16447087873660/BikeSharing?publish=yes)  

## Finding and Results  
A dashboard was put together to display the findings from this analysis.

Based on the results above, we can summarize the finding below:  
- Most of the subscribed users are males.
- Most of the trips have a rang of duration between 5 mins to 20 mins. This suggest that the distance between two bike stations shouldn't be too far.
- Trips mainly happen in weekdays during morning and evening rush hours. The users might be people who live in the area and don't need to commute too far to their workplace or school.

Combine the findings from the dashboard above and the locations where trips mostly starts, we can draw a conclusion that stations are needed in downtown area for users who live and go to work or school in the same area. This suggests a good amount of bikes and stations to be set up in the downtown area of Des Moines.
  
Future analysis could be conducted to visualize the quantity of rides by hours by station, which will help us estimate the amount of bikes to be prepared for each station. Addtional analysis can be conducted to map out the locations of public transpotation stops, ie subway stations, and the distance to nearby bike stations to estimate the impact on locations.
